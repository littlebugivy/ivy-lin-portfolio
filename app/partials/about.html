                                Hi. My name is Mengdie Lin and I go by Ivy. I am a first-year master student from the School of Information, University of
                                Michigan specialized in Human-computer Interaction (HCI). Before that, I studied computer
                                science at the University of Nottingham (two wonderful years in Ningbo, China and two unforgettable
                                years in Nottingham, UK).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                                I am a tech advancer and a user experience designer. Besides developing software to serve people's needs, I care about how
                                people think of and interact with technologies. I am excited about exploring emerging technologies
                                such as AR/VR, automobiles, smart homes but also dedicated to improving experience around
                                websites, mobile applications and online services which are used on daily basis. I believe
                                that technologies could better facilitate human activities and bring convenience and joy.
                                <b>
                                        I wish more people enjoy technologies, and enjoy it more.</b>
                        </p>


                        <p>
                                Besides the professional side of me, I am a person born with curiosity who loves trying and learning new things. I feed my
                                stomach with delicious food discovered via different methods and feed my brain with articles,
                                books, music, movies and stories from strangers. I love travelling and has been to nine countries.
                                I love jogging and have completed a half marathon last year. FYI. I also have a cat named
                                Orio.
