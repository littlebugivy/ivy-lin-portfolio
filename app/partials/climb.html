        <h1>Background Introduction</h1>
        Musicians have continuously been exploring the possibilities of presenting innovative musical experiences to their audiences.
        One of the pathways that they have gone done is the possibility of integration modern technologies, especially computational
        technologies, into music performance and production. In this project, Dr. Kallionpää</a> introduced a game-like
        musical composition, Climb!, with the intention to explore and understand the interaction between computer generated
        and human-performed piano pieces, in which the interaction may bring new experiences and interpretation of music
        to the audience.
        <br>
        <div class="center-content">
            <figure>

                <i>The game stucture of Climb!</i>
            </figcaption>
        </div>
        <p>
            As the name of the composition, Climb!, indicates, the musician goes from basecamp to summit. There are three paths with
            mulitple events and paths on the way, each of which represents one micro piano composition. The arrowed lines
            connecting stages are possible destinations of that stage. By performing differently, the musician determines
            the path, or say, experience that audiences go through, which leads to various versions of performances as a
            whole. The composition also involves a Disklavier piano, which performs automatically accompanying the musician
            as pre-defined.
        </p>
    </div>

<div id="neediden" class="project-main-container div-color1">
    <h1>Needs Identification</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            Through contexual inquiry with comprehensive field studies (attending three rehearsals), it is reliased that the performance
            is difficult to be interpreted. What's more, it causes confusion to audiences due to its complex ‘magical’ interactions.
            On the other hand, the innovative stucture of the composition is unpercivable to audiences. For example, different
            stages are undistinguishable from each other and their stories are not presented, which, if being revealed, could
            very likely raise more interests.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, at this stage the user needs are identified as:
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Need a better understanding of the entire performance setting.
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Need a better understanding of the hidden structure of the
            composition.

        <h1> Phase One of Design</h1>
        <p>
            The assisted tool is developed to be a web-based mobile application. Different from building native mobile applications,
            a web application allows rapid and flexible iterations, meanwhile, prevent users from downloading. Insipred by
            the paper programme notes used in traditional music concerts, the first phase of design incorporated a dynamic
            map. The appreance of the system adopts a mountain look to meet the leitmotiv of the performacne and the background
            is in dark blue to suit the dim environment during the performance. Each colored dot represent one micro-composition.
            The orange ones represents the ones have been visited and the red one is the present stage. The white ones indicate
            possible desitinations of the present stage, they are revealed one by one as the performance progress up the
            mountain. In each stage, a short narritive will be revealed to further introduce the context.
        </p>
        <p>
            One thing worths noting is that the design aims at scaffold understanding and interpretation of the work rather than to unpick
            audiences' specific interpretations.

    <h1>User Testing - Premiere</h1>
    <p>The premiere of Climb! took place in a classical recital hall as part of a regular series of contemporary music recitals
        at the University of Nottingham. The composer performed the work herself and around 50 audiences attended. The audience
        was a mixture of regular attendees for the event and those who had been invited by the research team. The regular
        attendees had a specific interest in contemporary music. Other attendees had much more diverse (mainstream) musical
        preferences, but most attendees reported at least “good” expertise in music.

        The experiment was designed as two run in the premiere. In the first round, audiences were given minimized information about
        the performance with the mobile application, while in the second round we offered a vocal introduction about the
        performance including its unique structure and special settings, and introduce how the mobile application connected
        to the performance. Paper questionnaires were given after each round of performance and interviews were conducted
        on five selected audiences. In two performances the musician chose different paths.

            After reflecting on analysis results and further discussions with Dr. Kallionpää, more needs are revealed regarding to the
            mobile application:
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. Incorporate introduction about the performance and
            allows customization to meet different interests
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. Allow to compare and contrast performances to suit
            the repetitive nature of the composition
            <br> To meet these needs, the second phase of design was designed and developed.

        The second phase of design was incorporated in the second performance in London in Augest after I finished the development
        and left the lab, therefore I didn't got the chance to participate in the user study on second phase. :(

        <p> The app was seen as useful and an enhancement as far as it went, although there were many suggestions for how it
            might be extended. Future directions would be:</p>
        <p>Interactive</p>
        <p>Audiences reported that the changing dots on the screen make them thought the system was interactive. Some of them
            tried to tab on the dots but nothing happend. In the future, the musician is thinking of letting audiences vote
            for paths, which could lead to interactions on mobile devices in a meaningful way.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Distraction</p>
        <p>
            How to eliminate the distraction caused by other medias on mobile devices requires further investigation. While the level
            of access to smartphones varies among individuals, and the distracion on mobile devices seems inevitable, an
            alternative way would be using devices particularly designed for the performance,which, however, raises further
            concerns on budget.
