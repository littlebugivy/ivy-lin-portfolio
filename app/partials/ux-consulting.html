                <p>
                    Wonder Resort is a historical resort with long-standing, personal relationships with guests and local communities and a strong
                    commitment to preserving history and following tradition. It is dedicated to offering exceptional accommodations,
                    excellent customer services and memorable guest experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wonder Resort has overall been tremendously successful in terms of fulfilling their mission and their business goal. However,
                    recently they received some complaints regarding reservation processes and requested us to access and
                    make recommendations. The scope of the project is limited to those processes relating to guest experience,
                    from the time a potential guest considers making a reservation at Wonder Resort through when they receive
                    a post-stay survey.

        <h1>Objective Overview</h1>
        <p>
            Through our analysis and interpretation of data obtained through employee interviews and from guest reviews and survey responses,
            we have identified two major areas of opportunity for Wonder Resort to improve their guest experience:
            <b>Guest Data Management
            </b> and
            <b>Information Delivery</b>. We believe that streamlining processes in these two areas will enable Wonder Resort
            to exceed guest expectations while also freeing up valuable organizational resources in the long-term.

            <h1>Background Research</h1>
            <h3>Secondary Research</h3>
            <p> We first conducted background research on Wonder Resort to understand its history, style, target audiences through
                multiple channels including their official websites, customer reviews online, travel agency review and presses.
            </p>


            <h3>Contextual Inquiry</h3>
            <p>
                To better understand the user experience, we interviewed six employees of Wonder Resort. The interviews took place at Wonder
                Resort over two days (October 22 and 23, 2017), and the resulting analysis was conducted during November
                2017. Prior to conducting interviews, we prepared semi-structured interview protocols relevant to each interviewee’s
                expertise and role in the organization. We also had the unique opportunity to act as guests while conducting
                this project, allowing us to experience and observe many relevant processes directly.

        <h1>Data Interpretation</h1>
        <h3>Data Collection</h3>
        <p>
            In addition to notes and audio recordings collected through our six employee interviews, Wonder Resort provided several additional
            data sources, including guest survey responses, internal reports, brochures and email templates.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Synthesis</h3>
        <p>
            The information gathered from these sources was analyzed using
            <b>‘affinity mapping’</b>. First, all the audios recordings were transcribed and statements were extracted to form
            individual data points. Then, all data points were written on individual sticky notes, or affinity notes. Then,
            the sticky notes were grouped into categories based on thematic similarities and each grouping was given a label
            that synthesized its data points into a clear, specific finding. This process was repeated twice more until all
            600+ sticky notes were incorporated into a few broad categories. These final groupings were then organized hierarchically
            and relationally along a wall, resulting in a visual model. The affinity mapping process and its tangible output
            provided us with a clearer understanding of the patterns and themes running through the data, highlighting areas
            of opportunity.
